  To calculate incoming damage, it is important to assume a type of damage you
  will be receiving.

  By default it is uniform: equal damage on all four resistances. But with
  these attributes you can set the damage profile to be more specific.

  NOTE: The total of these values should always be exactly one. If not, the
  effective hitpoints will be incorrect.
